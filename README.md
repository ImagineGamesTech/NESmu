# NESmu
An NES emulator for Windows and Mac.

## Info
NESmu is an NES emulator for Windows and Mac. It works by embedding EmulatorJS into an application using Electron, meaning you will experience lower lag than compared to EmulatorJS's demo. You can play .nes ROMs and .smc SNES ROMs.

## Run Online
To run online, go to <br>
`https://imaginegamestech.github.io/NESmu/emulate/run/`

## Mac Installation
1. Extract this zip.
2. Copy the .app file.
3. Paste it into Applications.
4. Run the app.
5. When a popup says something like, "This app can't be opened because it's not from a verified developer." it just means I don't want to pay Apple $100 a year.
6. To get around this, go into System Preferences.
7. Click on the lock labelled "Security" or something similar.
8. Next to "nesmu.app was blocked from running.", click "Open Anyway".
9. You're all set! Have fun!
